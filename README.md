## "YFN Success Tracker"

This project is aimed to show all the successes that happened in the Young Founders Network.
The goal is to have a simple input UI so that everybody can add successes and then show it in a simple format.
Ideally it would be readable in an RSS format, so that it can be implemented in other blogs.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

The project is deployed on render.com and can be seen here (https://yfn-successes.onrender.com/).
If you want to enhance the project, you are more then welcome.

1. Duplicate the project and add your own mongoDB atlas credentials in a .env file.
   (The free tier is sufficient)
2. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
3. Run ``npm run dev`to start the project

## Features
- user authentication with JWT to create a safe space to even show undisclosed news
- adding successes and defining which success someone had
- scrolling through success feed and feeling the imposter syndrome :)
- searching for a specific person in the community


## Goal

The goal is to have a simple input UI so that everybody can add successes and then show it in a simple format.
This project was also mainly a project to learn the basics of html & ejs, as well as implementing a MongoDB database.
Refactoring and tests were also implemented to enhance the code.
