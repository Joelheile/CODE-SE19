## "YFN Success Tracker" 
This project is aimed to show all the successes that happened in the Young Founders Network.
The goal is to have a simple input UI so that everybody can add successes and then show it in a simple format.
Ideally it would be readable in an rss format, so that it can be implemented in other Blogs
